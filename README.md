## DESCRIPTION ##

*Project Title: Classic Snake Game* – Built Using SFML in C++
*Project Overview:*
This project is a desktop-based graphical Snake Game, developed entirely in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The application simulates the classic arcade-style snake gameplay where the player navigates a growing snake to eat food and avoid collisions. This project demonstrates your proficiency in game logic, real-time rendering, keyboard input handling, collision detection, and audio integration.

You developed and compiled the application using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a lightweight yet powerful editor that supports modern C++ development with intellisense and debugging support. The game features sound effects, background music, dynamic difficulty adjustment, and a restart mechanism—giving it a complete game-loop experience.

*Technical Stack Used:*

. Language: C++

. Library: SFML (Graphics, Window, Audio modules)

. IDE: Visual Studio Code

. Platform: Windows Desktop

. Assets: Custom fonts (arial.ttf), sound effects (eat.wav, gameover.wav), and background music (background.ogg)

*Game Features:*

1. Responsive Snake Movement:

  . The player controls the snake using arrow keys.

  . Movement is smooth and grid-aligned using constant cell sizes.

2. Food Mechanics:

  . Randomly spawned red circles serve as food items.

  . Eating food increases the snake's length and score.

3. Score System:

  . The real-time score is displayed at the top-left corner.

  . Score increases by one for each food item consumed.

4. Dynamic Speed Adjustment:

  . The snake's speed increases as the score grows, providing a gradually harder challenge.

5. Collision Detection:

  . The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.

  . Collision detection uses sf::Vector2f comparisons for accuracy.

6. Game Over Logic:

  . A "Game Over" message is displayed with an option to restart the game by pressing 'R'.

  . The reset() method reinitializes game state and positions.

7. Audio Effects:

  . Eating food triggers a sound (eat.wav).

  . Game over event triggers another sound (gameover.wav).

  . Looping background music plays during the game for an immersive experience.

*Where Can This Application Be Used?*

1. Portfolio Projects / Resume Building:

  . This game serves as a strong portfolio project for internships or job applications in game development, software engineering, or C++ roles.

  . You can showcase this as a complete, interactive desktop application, not just console-based logic.

2. Game Development Practice:

  . It acts as a base for experimenting with new mechanics such as scoreboards, levels, or AI-based enemy snakes.

  . You can upgrade it into a multiplayer version or port it to mobile/HTML5 with tools like SFML-Mobile or Emscripten.

3. Academic Submission:

  . This is suitable for college coursework, mini-projects, or semester assignments.

  . It demonstrates understanding of object-oriented programming, file handling (loading assets), and event-driven programming.

4. Internship or Certification Projects:

  . Since your task was “Development: Snake Game”, this project perfectly fulfills those requirements using a widely accepted industry toolchain (VS Code + C++).

  . You can submit this for certifications, such as internship evaluations or online bootcamp completions.

5.  Open-Source Contribution:

  . You can publish this game on platforms like GitHub and contribute it to beginner-friendly open-source repositories.

  . Other learners can fork, test, and extend your codebase.

6. Entertainment / Self-Use:

  . As a fully functioning desktop application, the game is playable for fun.

  . With a few changes, it can be packaged as a .exe installer and shared with friends or uploaded to game platforms like itch.io.

*Conclusion:*

This Snake Game reflects not only your programming capability but also your ability to design a structured, extensible, and interactive GUI application. The project blends object-oriented programming with real-time game mechanics using a multimedia library. It’s a strong example of practical application of C++ and SFML for anyone looking to break into the world of game development or desktop application design.
